            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>This is a template editor for minecraft <a href="https://mcdiamondfire.com">Diamondfire</a> which simply is a server about coding minigames.
                <br/>What this web application does is modify templates, which are items which save code. It aim is to be easy although is in development but at it's current stage it can edit the raw data of a template, enough to edit a template in any way.
                <br/>I'm adding a method of visual programming, similar to the discontinued DfVisual, to give an easy method of editing templates.</p>
            <h1>How to use it?</h1>
            <h2>Importing your template.</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Get the code data. If you have <a href="https://codeutilities.github.io/">codeutilities</a>, this is easy.<br/>
            Hold your template which you want to modify, and type /itemdata in chat. Click on any of formatted, unformatted or /dfive version. This should put some text on your clipboard.<br/>
            Step 2: With this on your clipboard you should be able to paste it into the Code To Import box, and press import. The website will automaticly grab the template data, and put it in the editor.</p>
            <h2>Editing Templates</h2>
            <p>There are multiple ways of doing this.<br/>
            Method 1: editing the raw template data, if you understand json you will be able to edit it after looking at it for a bit. Although templates are formmated a little strange.<br/>
            Method 2: You can click on the previewed blocks, which shows you some info, like the text shown on the sign, or all piston options. This is not fully released.</p>
