<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>This is a template editor for Minecraft <a href="https://mcdiamondfire.com">Diamondfire</a>, which is a server about coding minigames.<br/>
What this web application does is modify templates, which are items that save code. It aims to be easy, although it is in development, at its current stage, it can edit the raw data of a template enough to edit a template in any way.<br/>
I'm adding a visual programming method, similar to the discontinued DfVisual, to give an easy way of editing templates.</p>
<h1>How to use it?</h1>
<h2>Importing your template.</h2>
<b>Step 1:</b> Get the code data. If you have <a href="https://codeutilities.github.io/">Code Utilities</a>, this is easy.<br/>
Hold your template, which you want to modify, and type /itemdata in chat. Then, click on any formatted, unformatted or /dfgive version. This should put some text on your clipboard.<br/>
<b>Step 2:</b> With this on your clipboard, you should paste it into the Code To Import box and press import. The website will automatically grab the template data and put it in the editor.<br/>
<h2>Editing Templates</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways of doing this.<br/>
Method 1: editing the raw template data; if you understand JSON, you will edit it after looking at it for a bit. However, templates are formated a little strange.<br/>
Method 2: You can click on the previewed blocks, which shows you some info, like the text shown on the sign or all piston options. Click and edit is not fully released.</p>
